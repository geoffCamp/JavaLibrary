\f0\fs24 \cf0 Testing plan will involve testing the following aspects of the program:\
\
Command menu:\
 - all options respond as expected\
 \
Add:\
 - call number, title, year cannot be empty\
 - publisher, organization, authors can be empty\
 - year handles non numeric input and out of bounds input\
 - author cannot have \'91%\'92 in name\
 - prevent adding duplicate entry with same year and call number\
 - adding to an already existing key in hash map\
\
Search: \
 - will handle empty input\
 - will return all entries when no search terms selected\
 - will handle one, two, or none years chosen\
 - correct number of books and journals are displayed\
 - case sensitivity off\
 - searching with multiple books and journals displays all which are appropriate in the correct  order\
 - matches entries regardless of word ordering\
 - must match all specified terms\
 - search will return journals and books\
 - when reference not contained in list\
 - when reference at start of list\
 - when reference at end of list\
 - when reference in \'93middle\'94 of list\
\
File I/O\
- writes additions to file\
- reads entries from file and adds to ref list\
- handles file path arguments\
\
Test Cases:\
\
Add\
- for empty call number, year, and/or title\
   input: \'93\'94\
   output: "Title and call number must be specified."\
- for non numeric year\

   output: \'93Please enter a valid year.\'94\
- for year out of bounds\
   input: 999\
    output: "Please enter a valid year."\
\
Search\
- for title case sensitivity off\
  input: \'93java programming\'94\
  output: displayed book titled \'93Java Programming\'94\
- for different word ordering\
   input: \'93programming java\'94\
   output: displayed book titled \'93Java Programming\'94\
- Number of years specified\
   input1: \'932000\'93\
   output1: all books and journals published 2000 and later\
   input2: 2000 and 2005\
   output2: all books and journals published between 2000 and 2005 inclusive\
\
File I/O\
 - writes additions\
 input: (book entry)\
 output: (book to string in output file)\
- reads references from input file\
result: ref list non empty after start-up}
